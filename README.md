# CS-305
1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
  Artemis Financial is an international banking application that was looking to modernize their systems. Due to the sensitive nature of their data they handle, they required extra security measures to keep their clients safe.

2. What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  Upon finding the Artemis Financial's vulnerabilities, I was able to address them by updating outdated dependencies and suppressing false positives.

3. What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  I found the vulnerability assessment to be extremely helpful in addressing vulnerabilities, however, suppressing false positives was extremely tedious.
  
4. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  To increase layers of security I added the SHA-256 algorithm and added HTTPS with a self signed certificate for secure communication.
  
5. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  To ensure my code was functional and secure, I would conduct functional tests. I also would check for dependencies before and after refactoring to identify whether any new dependencies were introduced.

6. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  The OWASP dependency check is definitely something I'll likely use again as well as the Vulnerability Assessment. 
  
7. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
Employers may see that I am capable of producing secure and quality code.
